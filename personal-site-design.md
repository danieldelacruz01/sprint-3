What is your site's primary purpose?

Currently, the site's primary purpose is for me to summarise and reflect on the things I learn each week at EDA in a blog format. It's a way for me to keep track of my cultural and technical development throughout my EDA journey. In 20 or 30 weeks' time, I want to be able to look back at my blog posts and see how far I've come since I started on November 30.

Who is your target audience?

Bearing in mind the primary purpose of my site, I think I am my own target audience. I believe it might also serve a purpose for friends and family to keep up to date with what I've been up to at EDA, so the site should also be designed with their needs in mind. Finally, just like I have been reading the blog posts of other people in my cohort to find out about their perspective on EDA so far, I think it would be useful to consider them (as well as people who are considering taking the course) as a target audience in case they want to read about EDA from my perspective.


How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I would like the experiences of vistors to my site to be informative and insightful. With this in mind, I think the site should focus primarily on content, rather than looks or functionality. That being said, a blog that is not just informative, but looks nice too would be a welcome bonus. On top of this, the site should be responsive so that the device visitors are accessing it from does not inhibit their ability to engage with its content.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

Given that the site is currently text-only, I think I could do some work to make it more visually stimulating. Adding images, backgrounds, webfonts that are consistent with each other and reflect my personal 'brand'. On the functional side, I think the site could be improved in terms of navigability, with a more clearly defined structure (instead of just having links to every blog. post in the navigation bar, I might add sub-menus). I will also work on incorporating responsive design elements into my site build.
